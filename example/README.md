## üéØ Scenarios Demonstrated

### Offline-First Collaborative Data Sync

All demos showcase production-ready patterns for building offline-first applications:

1. **Client-First Data Creation**
   - GUIDs generated client-side to prevent ID collisions
   - Data created without server connectivity
   - Sync operations tracked for later server upload

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Last-Write-Wins (LWW) timestamps for concurrent edits
   - Conflict detection and resolution strategies
   - Multi-device collaboration scenarios

3. **Reactive Data Access**
   - Stream-based UI updates with real-time synchronization
   - Query builder integration for complex filtering
   - Type-safe database operations

4. **Professional Architecture**
   - Declarative schema management with automatic migration
   - Centralized database service with global access
   - Clean separation of concerns and reusable components

## üìä Database Schema Examples

### Shop Floor Schema
```dart
SchemaBuilder()
  // Orders with GUID primary keys
  .table('orders', (table) => table
      .text('id', (col) => col.primaryKey()) // UUID for offline-first
      .text('order_number', (col) => col.notNull().unique())
      .text('customer_name', (col) => col.notNull())
      .text('status', (col) => col.notNull().withDefaultValue('pending'))
      .real('total_amount', (col) => col.withDefaultValue(0.0))
      .text('priority', (col) => col.withDefaultValue('medium'))
      .index('idx_order_status', ['status']))
  
  // Notes with collaborative editing support
  .table('notes', (table) => table
      .text('id', (col) => col.primaryKey()) // UUID for offline-first
      .text('order_id', (col) => col.notNull())
      .text('content', (col) => col.notNull())
      .text('author', (col) => col.notNull())
      .integer('is_synced', (col) => col.withDefaultValue(0)) // Sync tracking
      .text('created_on_device')) // Device attribution
```

### Advanced Query Examples
```dart
// Complex aggregation with joins
final revenueByRegion = await database.rawQuery('''
  SELECT 
    c.region,
    COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value
  FROM customers c
  JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
  WHERE o.status = 'completed'
  GROUP BY c.region
  ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
''');

// Subquery patterns
final topCustomers = await database.rawQuery('''
  SELECT company_name, industry, region
  FROM customers
  WHERE id IN (
    SELECT customer_id 
    FROM orders 
    WHERE total_amount > (
      SELECT AVG(total_amount) FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed'
    )
  )
''');
```
