# RxDart Integration for Stream Lifecycle Management

## Problem Analysis

The QueryListView was experiencing rapid subscribe/cancel/subscribe cycles that caused several issues:

1. **Subscription churn**: StreamBuilder would rapidly subscribe and unsubscribe from streams during widget rebuilds
2. **Missing initial data**: New subscribers wouldn't get the last emitted value immediately  
3. **Query recreation overhead**: QueryListView was recreating StreamingQuery instances unnecessarily
4. **Unbatched refreshes**: Multiple database changes triggered individual query refreshes instead of being batched

## Solution Implementation

### 1. RxDart BehaviorSubject Integration

**File**: `declarative_sqlite/lib/src/streaming/streaming_query.dart`

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced `StreamController<List<T>>` with `BehaviorSubject<List<T>>` from RxDart
- Added `doOnListen()` and `doOnCancel()` operators for proper lifecycle management
- BehaviorSubject automatically replays the last emitted value to new subscribers

**Benefits**:
- **Immediate data delivery**: New subscribers get the last value instantly, eliminating loading flickers
- **Robust subscription handling**: BehaviorSubject handles rapid subscription changes gracefully
- **Reduced query execution**: Avoids re-executing queries when data hasn't changed

### 2. Debounced Query Refreshes

**File**: `declarative_sqlite/lib/src/streaming/query_stream_manager.dart`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `PublishSubject<String>` with `debounceTime(Duration(milliseconds: 16))` for table changes
- Implemented batched processing of table change notifications
- Added `distinct()` operator to filter duplicate table change events

**Benefits**:
- **Reduced refresh cycles**: Multiple rapid database changes are debounced into single refresh operations
- **Better performance**: Eliminates unnecessary query executions during bulk operations
- **Smoother UI updates**: Single-frame debouncing provides smooth user experience

### 3. Smart Query Recreation

**File**: `declarative_sqlite_flutter/lib/src/query_list_view.dart`

**Changes Made**:
- Added query signature generation using SQL + parameters as identity
- Implemented smart change detection in `_handleWidgetChanges()`
- Only recreate StreamingQuery when the actual query logic changes, not on every widget rebuild

**Benefits**:
- **Stable streaming queries**: Avoids unnecessary StreamingQuery disposal and recreation
- **Reduced subscription churn**: Maintains same stream instance across widget rebuilds
- **Improved performance**: Eliminates redundant query analysis and setup

## Key Technical Improvements

### BehaviorSubject Stream Pipeline

```dart
/// The stream of query results with automatic replay of last value and lifecycle management
Stream<List<T>> get stream {
  return _subject.stream
      .doOnListen(() {
        developer.log('StreamingQuery.stream.doOnListen: First listener subscribed to query id="$_id"', name: 'StreamingQuery');
        _onListen();
      })
      .doOnCancel(() {
        developer.log('StreamingQuery.stream.doOnCancel: Last listener unsubscribed from query id="$_id"', name: 'StreamingQuery');  
        _onCancel();
      });
}
```

### Debounced Table Change Processing

```dart
QueryStreamManager() {
  // Debounce table changes to batch rapid notifications and prevent subscribe/cancel cycles
  _tableChangeSubscription = _tableChangeSubject
      .debounceTime(const Duration(milliseconds: 16)) // Single frame delay
      .distinct() // Only process unique table names
      .listen(_processTableChange);
}
```

### Query Signature-Based Change Detection

```dart
/// Generate a signature for the current query to detect meaningful changes
String _generateQuerySignature() {
  final builder = QueryBuilder();
  widget.query(builder);
  
  // Build the SQL to use as signature (this captures all meaningful changes)
  try {
    final (sql, params) = builder.build();
    return '$sql|${params.join(',')}';
  } catch (e) {
    // If build fails, fall back to table name + hash of widget.query function
    return '${builder.tableName}_${widget.query.hashCode}';
  }
}
```

## Performance Benefits

1. **Eliminated loading flickers**: BehaviorSubject replay provides immediate data to new subscribers
2. **Reduced database load**: Debouncing prevents excessive query executions
3. **Stable widget performance**: Smart change detection avoids unnecessary stream recreations
4. **Better memory usage**: Proper stream lifecycle management prevents memory leaks

## Dependencies Added

```yaml
dependencies:
  rxdart: ^0.28.0  # Added to declarative_sqlite/pubspec.yaml
```

## Testing Results

The improvements successfully address the original issues:
- ✅ Rapid subscribe/cancel/subscribe cycles are handled gracefully
- ✅ No more unsubscribed states after initial widget loads  
- ✅ Query changes are properly detected and applied
- ✅ Database refresh operations are efficiently batched

## Migration Notes

This is a **backward-compatible** change. Existing code continues to work without modifications, but now benefits from:
- More stable streaming behavior
- Better performance under heavy subscription churn
- Immediate data delivery for new subscribers
- Reduced resource usage during bulk database operations
